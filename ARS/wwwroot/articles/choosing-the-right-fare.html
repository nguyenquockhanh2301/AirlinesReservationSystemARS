    <p>
      Many travellers want flexibility in case their plans change. Use this page to outline which fares are non-refundable,
      which allow date changes, and what fees or price differences apply. You can also explain how upgrades work and what
      benefits are included with premium cabins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Include examples of common scenarios (business trips, family holidays, weekend breaks) and recommend the
      most suitable fare type for each.
