      When you book for several travellers at once, keeping all details together makes the journey smoother. Outline how
      your system handles multiple passengers under one reservation, how seat selection works for a group, and how changes
      or cancellations affect everyone on the booking.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also add information here about name changes, special assistance, and how to contact support for complex
      itineraries.
