        This demo application is an educational sample for an airline reservation system. It is not a real airline and
        should not be used to store real passenger or payment information.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">What data is stored</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">
        The system can store sample data such as cities, flights, schedules, reservations, and basic user profiles.
        When you run the project locally, this data is stored only in your configured database instance.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Use of personal information</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">
        Any names, email addresses, or other details you enter while testing the application are used solely to
        demonstrate how the booking and account features work. They are not transmitted to any external services by
        this codebase.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Cookies and sessions</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">
        The application uses cookies and session state to keep you logged in and to maintain your booking flow. These
        values are stored in your browser and cleared according to your browser settings or when you sign out.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Demo only</h2>

        This project is intended for learning and experimentation. Before deploying a production system based on this
